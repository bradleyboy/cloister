# Request for Proposal: Local hub for Claude Code history

Summary: You have the opportunity to submit a proposal to build a local hub that can show all conversations with Claude Code in a well designed, searchable browser interface.

## Requirements

* The interface should run locally via a simple, one line command. Ideally, it will run as a daemon in the background.
* The user should be able to see all past and current sessions in a list on the home page.
* Sessions should be automatically classified with tags and be searchable based on those tags or other metadata.
* Visual design is of upmost importance to this client and will likely be the differentiator for the winning proposal. Since so of Claude Code is, well, _code_, a well designed code block will be needed.
* Equally important is information architecture. Think of the sort of components Claude usually uses in its output and ensure there are visual components to support them.
* Viewing a currently in-progress session should autoupdate if that session is open in a browser.

## Mechanism

Since you are Claude Code, you know best what mechanism should be used (Plugin, Skill, something else?). Include this in your proposal.

## Format

The initial plan should include an example of some sort, this can be a simple standalone HTML page or some other visual artifact to settle on the design before building the full solution.

## Stack

It is up to you to define the appropriate stack to meet the requirements (for example: is a database necessary?).

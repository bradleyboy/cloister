# Re: v1 of claude notebook after fixes

Some bugs we are still seeing:

* Scroll the bottom is not working
* good job with more info for things like todowrite, what about others like `TaskList`?
* i'm seeing many code blocks (that are not diffs) are still not highlighting
* at times, when scrolling through the content, scroll snaps back to the bottom.
* for long sessions, performance is really suffering (clicking the session in the list -> rendering it takes seconds)
